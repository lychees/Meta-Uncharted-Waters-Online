# Meta-Uncharted-Waters-Online

A 2D MMORPG with a nautical theme.
It allows players to go back to the Middle Ages and take on the role of heroes in an adventure.
The game includes an adventure story line carefully designed by the creator over a long period of time, while players are free to collect experience, gain savings, engage in economic and trade activities, and upgrade their ships. Participate in maritime battles, obtain loot, and expand the world map. At the same time, the game introduces a weather system, the management of supplies during the voyage, and a more difficult and realistic combat experience in order to add a more realistic sailing experience.

Currently the game is on Algo network, users can log in and participate in the game through Algo Wallet, in the future the game will be more deeply bound for Algo network, including but not only assets. We will listen to more ideas on the game mechanics.
